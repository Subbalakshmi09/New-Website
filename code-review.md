#Code Review (AI)
 A code review of my website conducted by AI. Practicing using AI to support my programming development. This is the output:

        1. Unnecessary Commented Code
You have several commented-out sections (<style>, <nav>, <img>, etc.). If they're no longer needed, consider removing them to clean up the code.

2. HTML Syntax Issues
There is a stray </tsp> tag inside the commented-out <nav>. Since <tsp> is not a valid HTML tag, you should remove it.

The <p> tag inside <section class="moreinfo"> is incorrectly closed after the section ends:

html
Copy
Edit
</section>
</p> <!-- This closing tag shouldn't be here -->
Fix: Move </p> inside the <section> or remove it.

3. Improve Accessibility (a11y)
The nav menu should have a role="navigation" attribute for better screen reader support:

html
Copy
Edit
<nav role="navigation">
Use semantic <header> and <footer> instead of <div class="header">. Example:

html
Copy
Edit
<header class="header">
The <h1> should be the main page heading, and you should avoid skipping heading levels.

4. Add alt Attributes to All Images
Your main logo <img> has an alt attribute, but images inside sections like:

html
Copy
Edit
<img src="images/autisk_img1.jpg" alt="Autisk Building">
Consider making these alt texts more descriptive for accessibility.

5. Improve Readability
Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces per level).

The <aside> is currently placed inside <main>, which isn't best practice. Move it outside <main>:

html
Copy
Edit
<aside>...</aside> 
<footer>...</footer> 
6. Use a More Descriptive <title>
The <title> is "Autisk", which could be expanded for better SEO:

html
Copy
Edit
<title>Autisk - Support for Families with Additional Needs</title>
7. Use rel="noopener noreferrer" in External Links
For security and performance, modify external links like this:

html
Copy
Edit
<a href="https://signpostforcarers.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
